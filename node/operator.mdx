title: 'Run a Chainbase AVS Operator (Not released to mainnet yet)'
---

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Chainbase AVS (Actively Validated Service) operator node. Please note that this service is not yet released to the mainnet.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

âž•[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Docker is a requirement for AVS operator.

âž•[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):  Docker Compose is used alongside Docker for executing Operator software.

âž• **Linux Environment**: Eigenlayerâ€™s CLI only runs in a Linux environment.

âž•[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install): Two out of three installation routes require the use of Go. Itâ€™s safer to go with Go than go without. ðŸ˜‰


## Installation Process

### Migration From Previous Version

If you've previously run a Chainbase AVS Operator:
1. Back up your encrypted **ECDSA** and **BLS** keys.
2. Skip the **EigenLayer Registration** step.

### EigenLayer Registration

Ensure you've registered with EigenLayer before proceeding. For guidance, refer to the [EigenLayer Operator Installation Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).

### Chainbase AVS Setup

1. Clone the Chainbase AVS setup repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/chainbase-avs-setup && cd chainbase-avs-setup/holesky
   ```

2. Set up the environment file:
```
mv .env.example .env
   ```
Configure all fields in the `.env` file with your specific information:
```
NODE_ECDSA_KEY_FILE_PATH=/your/ecdsa/key/path
NODE_BLS_KEY_FILE_PATH=/your/bls/key/path
OPERATOR_ECDSA_KEY_PASSWORD=yourECDSAKeyPassword
OPERATOR_BLS_KEY_PASSWORD=yourBlsKeyPassword
   ```

3. Edit the `node.yaml` file:
- **operator_address**: Set to your operator address (must match your ECDSA key address).
- **node_socket**: Set to your server's public IP address (format: `<your_public_ip>:8011`).

Important:
- Ensure your server's public IP is internet-accessible.
- Verify that port 8011 is open and properly configured in your firewall settings.

4. Set execution permissions for the script:
```shell
chmod +x ./chainbase-avs.sh
```

5. update `holesky/prometheus.yml`'s `${YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME}`

replace this with your Operator name you want to be identified by, it helps us route alerts and metrics to your notification channels easily

## Operating the Chainbase AVS

### Register as an Operator

Run the following command to register as an operator:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh register
```

### Run Chainbase AVS Node

Run the following command to startup chainbase avs node:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh run
```

### Monitor Logs

View container logs using any of these commands:
```shell
docker compose logs -f
docker compose logs -f <container_name>
docker logs -f <container_id>
```
