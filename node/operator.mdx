title: 'Run a Operator(Not released to mainnet yet)'
---

## Requirements

âž•[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Docker is a requirement for AVS operators.

âž•[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):  Docker Compose is used alongside Docker for executing Operator software. 

âž•Linux Environment: Eigenlayerâ€™s CLI only runs in a Linux environment.

âž•[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install): Two out of three installation routes require the use of Go. Itâ€™s safer to go with Go than go without. ðŸ˜‰

## EigenLayer Registration

Before registering as an AVS, ensure that the operator has already registered with EigenLayer. 
For reference, see [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation)

## Chainbase AVS Contract Registration

1. `git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/chainbase-avs-contracts.git`

2. rename `avs.toml.example` to `avs.toml` and replace filed: `operator_config_path`,`keystore_pwd`

```yaml
operator_config_path = "/path/to/operator.yaml"
keystore_pwd = "your_keystore_password"
avs_contract_address="0x5E78eFF26480A75E06cCdABe88Eb522D4D8e1C9d"
avs_dir_contract_address="0x055733000064333CaDDbC92763c58BF0192fFeBf"
rpc_url="https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_holesky"
```

The `operator.yaml` file is created when you register as an operator using the EigenLayer CLI. You should use the same file created during that process and do not need to modify it.

1. download the latest chainbase-avs-cli release from [here](https://github.com/chainbase-labs/chainbase-avs-contracts/releases)


2. Run the following command to register as an operator:

```
chainbase-avs-cli register --config  ~/path/to/avs.toml
``` 

## Run AVS

2. Edit `operator.yaml`'s `private_key_store_path` point to `/opt/operator.yaml`.


```shell
export OPERATOR_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/operator.yaml  EIGEN_KEY_PATH=/path/to/ecdsa.key.json

docker-compose up --build -d
```
