## 1. blast.erc20_approval
### Table Description
The ERC20_approval event is a key component of the ERC20 token standard, one of the most widely used token standards on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 tokens are fungible tokens, meaning each token is identical and holds the same value as others of the same type, much like traditional currencies. In the ERC20 standard, the approval function and the corresponding Approval event play a crucial role in enabling delegated token transfers. This feature allows token holders to give permission to another account, typically a smart contract or another user, to transfer a specified amount of their tokens on their behalf. This mechanism is essential for many decentralized applications (dApps) and services within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 2. blast.erc20_transfer
### Table Description
The ERC20_transfer event is a fundamental component of the ERC20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical to every other token of the same type, similar to traditional currencies. This standard is widely adopted for the creation of fungible digital assets on blast. In ERC20, the transfer function and the corresponding Transfer event are critical for moving tokens from one account to another. This is the primary mechanism through which token balances are adjusted within the network.
